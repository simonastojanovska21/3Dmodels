# 3Dmodels

In this repository you can see the 3D models I have build so far. 

The file named as room.blend contains 3D models of object usually find in a bedroom (bed, desk, wardrobe...). On the following link you can see a video made as a virtual room tour. https://youtu.be/sSpQjIKk1wQ

In the file EQS.blend there is a 3D model of the EQS Mercedes-Benz vehicle. This model was later used to create a car commercial, which can be seen on the following link. https://youtu.be/fbwY9sBjDTo
